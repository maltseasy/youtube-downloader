# youtube-downloader

Version 1.2(Latest)

A easy to use python script that downloads youtube videos in whatever format they were uploaded in. Just type in what you want to search and it will download the first video link into the folder which the script is in.

This is my first project on github and I'm not thaaat experienced with python(and I'm 12) so any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

#How to use:

1. Make sure you have all the requirements
2. Download .py file(latest version)
3. Run .py file
4. Input the name of the video you want to download from youtube
5. Press enter and after a short while, your video will be downloaded into the folder with the python file.
6. The file type may be weird(mkd,webm) and W.M.P. cant play most of them so I recommend VLC media player.
